SeqAn is an free and open source software library, released to the public under the terms described in the `license file <./LICENSE>`__, but to stay safe we require that all contributors `sign the contributor license agreement <https://www.clahub.com/agreements/seqan/seqan>`__. Really, it's just a few clicks.

Without signing the agreement, you cannot create pull requests.


Workflow, Code Style et cetera
------------------------------

Before you start coding, please read through the `Contributor Guide <http://seqan.readthedocs.io/en/master/Infrastructure/Contribute/index.html>`__ in our manual.

Before submitting, mentally check of these boxes:
* [ ] the pull request is against the develop branch
* [ ] it follows the SeqAn code style guide
* [ ] the git history is concise and the commits follow the commit naming scheme

It will make life easier for both you, the contributor, and our maintainers who review the code. Contributions that clearly indicate that you have not read the Contributor Guide will be closed without extensive review.
